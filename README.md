# 💸 RiWards

**Revolutionizing cashback rewards with instant, transparent blockchain payments.**
Riwards is built for the Ripple Hackathon, this MVP demonstrates how the XRP Ledger can power real-time cashback for online shopping experiences.

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

1. User shops on a demo product page (e.g., **Fake Nike Shoes – \$100**).
2. They enter their **XRP wallet address**.
3. Upon “purchase” (mocked), they **instantly receive cashback** in XRP.
4. The cashback transaction is **broadcasted on XRPL Testnet**.
5. A link to the blockchain explorer is provided to verify the transaction.

💡 **No real money involved** — testnet XRP is used throughout.
